This application is built using the foundational pillars of Object Oriented Programing, or OOP. Class constructors were used in order to take advantage of inheritence, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. This particular methodology enables "DRY" code, or don't repeat yourself code. Code that isn't "DRY" can confuse readers and contributors to projects, making OOP important to learn and practice. It is a practice that is used in multiple different coding languages as well.  

Another important practice for all developers is TDD, or test driven development. The practice of TDD entails writing simple tests that code must pass before writing the actual code. By using the NPM package Jest, we are able to write code that allows us to test methods that appear in js files, ensuring they function properly before deployment. 

Thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoy the program!
